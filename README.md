# Faillapop - Project Documentation

## ðŸ“Œ Based On

This project is an **extension and adaptation of the original [`faillapop`](https://github.com/jcsec-security/faillapop)** repository developed by [jcsec-security](https://github.com/jcsec-security). It builds upon its architecture and concept, introducing improvements in user experience, interface, and features on the Ethereum blockchain.

---

## Description

**Faillapop** is a decentralized marketplace application that enables users to buy and sell products using blockchain technology (Ethereum). It integrates with MetaMask to manage identities and transactions, offering distinct roles such as buyer, seller, and admin.

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:mredaht/Faillapop2.0.git
   cd contracts
   forge install
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

### Smart Contracts (using Foundry)

1. Start a local blockchain:
   ```bash
   anvil
   ```

2. In a new terminal, compile the contracts:
   ```bash
   forge build
   ```

3. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   forge test
   ```

4. Deploy the contracts:
   ```bash
   forge script script/DeployFaillapop.s.sol --broadcast
   ```

---

### Frontend

1. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **React 16.3.0**
- **TypeScript**
- **Custom CSS**
- **React Router DOM** for navigation
- **Context API** for global state management
- **MetaMask** for Ethereum integration
