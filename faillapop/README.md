# Mock audit exercise!

I sometimes feel that the jump between being able to identify issues in small snippets of code and auditing a more complex codebase is problematic. There are a loooot of small CTF-like exercises, some easy some really difficult, but feel like there is a lack of a "mock audit contract" for people to practice their skills in a closer to real-life project. 

So I decided to create the Faillapop protocol!


## The Faillapop protocol 🛍️

The Faillapop protocol is a vulnerable-by-design protocol to help Web3 security students practice their skills in a fun environment. The protocol is composed of multiple contracts that interact with each other to create a decentralized buying and selling platform. Disputes are resolved through a DAO and malicious sellers are checked by forcing a deposit before selling anything... but there have been a lot of bad decisions during this process :mag:. 


You will find common solidity security issues, dubious centralization and logical loopholes. Do not forget to think about others such as flash loans and Out-Of-Gas exceptions! 

Try to perform a full mock audit! Create your own professional report mimicking those of well-known companies such as Oak Security, Trail of Bits, Hacken, or Halborn. Imagine that you are getting paid for this and trying to do the best job possible! not just finding bugs but also crafting proper paragraphs for your report. 


Solutions are not provided along this repo but the documentation has been created following the NatSpec format and the following diagram will help you get a grasp of the whole architecture.

> [!TIP]
> Do not forget to run and analyze the testing suite. Sometimes you can spot vulnerabilities just by checking the bits that were neglected during testing and ensuring they behave as expected, or just reviewing failed tests.

## Next steps

The current version is `v1.0`. At the moment I would like to achieve the below in order to upgrade it:


:pushpin:`V2.0`

- Oracle
- Flash loan provider

## Working with the Faillapop Protocol 🛠️

The Faillapop protocol uses the Foundry framework. 

>**Why Foundry?**
>- It is the fastest framework
>- Allows writing tests and scripts in Solidity, minimising context switches
>- It has a lot of cheatcodes for testing and debugging

Foundry is composed of four components:
- [**Forge**](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/crates/forge): Ethereum Testing Framework
- [**Cast**](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/crates/cast): A command line tool for making RPC calls to Ethereum. Allowing to interact with smart contracts, send transactions or retrieve any kind of data from the Blockchain through the console
- [**Anvil**](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/crates/anvil): A local Ethereum node, similar to Ganache, which is deployed by default during test execution
- [**Chisel**](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/crates/chisel): A solidity REPL, very fast and useful during contract development or testing

To work with the Faillapop protocol, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Foundry Framework

The recommended way to install it is using the **foundryup** tool. Below we will go through the installation step by step, but if you want to do a dependency-free installation, you can follow the installation instructions from [this repository](https://github.com/hardenerdev/smart-contract-auditor).

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using Windows, you will need to install and use [Git BASH](https://gitforwindows.org/) or [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) as the terminal, as Foundryup does not support Powershell or Cmd.

In the terminal run:

```Powershell
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

As a result you will get something like this:

```shell
consoleDetected your preferred shell is bashrc and added Foundry to Path run:source /home/user/.bashrcStart a new terminal session to use Foundry
```

Now simply type `foundryup` in the terminal and press `Enter`. This will install the four Foundry components: *forge*, *cast*, *anvil* and *chisel*.

To confirm the correct installation, type `forge --version`. You should get the installed version of forge:

```shell 
Forge version x.x.x
```
If you have not obtained the version, you may need to add Foundry to your PATH. To do this, you can run the following:

```shell
cd ~echo 'source /home/user/.bashrc' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

If you still have problems with the installation, you can follow Foundry's installation instructions in their [repository](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

### 2. Set Up the Project

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jcsec-security/solidity-security-course-resources.git
cd solidity-security-course-resources/faillapop
```

Build the project using Foundry:

```shell
forge build
```

### 3. Run the Tests

To run the test suite, use the following command:

```shell
forge test
```

This will run all the tests in the `tests` directory.
